# 💡 DevSecOps Project

This repository showcases a comprehensive **DevSecOps workflow** that seamlessly integrates **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **CI/CD automation**, and **built-in security practices**. The solution leverages industry-standard tools including **Terraform**, **GitHub Actions**, **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, and **ArgoCD** to build a scalable, secure, and automated deployment pipeline.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete DevSecOps pipeline to deploy a sample cloud-native application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Key components of the workflow include:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Provisioning infrastructure using **Terraform**, ensuring reproducibility and version control.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automating the build, test, and deployment lifecycle with **GitHub Actions**.
- **Security Integration:** Embedding security checks into every stage of the pipeline to ensure compliance and reduce risk.
- **GitOps-Based Deployment:** Leveraging **ArgoCD** for declarative and automated continuous delivery to AKS.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The architecture comprises the following components:

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Manages containerized application workloads.
- **Terraform:** Provisions all necessary Azure infrastructure including the AKS cluster.
- **GitHub Actions:** Triggers workflows on code commits, automating CI/CD tasks.
- **ArgoCD:** Enables GitOps-based deployment, ensuring application state aligns with the Git repository.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

Implemented via **GitHub Actions**, the CI/CD pipeline includes the following stages:

1. **Build & Test:** Automatically triggered on push; compiles the code and runs unit/integration tests.
2. **Security Scanning:** Performs static code analysis and scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
3. **Deployment:** Upon successful validation, ArgoCD deploys the application to AKS using a declarative approach.

> Workflow definitions can be found in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

## 🔒 Security Integration

Security is integrated at every step of the pipeline, following DevSecOps principles:

- **Static Code Analysis:** Tools like **SonarQube** scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Automatically detects known issues in third-party libraries.
- **Container Image Scanning:** Tools like **Trivy** scan Docker images for vulnerabilities prior to deployment.
- **Infrastructure Security:** Terraform code is validated for misconfigurations and compliance issues.

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

Robust observability is crucial for application reliability. This project integrates modern monitoring and logging tools:

- **Prometheus:** Collects and stores time-series metrics from the application and cluster.
- **Grafana:** Visualizes metrics through dynamic, user-friendly dashboards.

> *(Optional integrations for logging solutions like ELK or Azure Monitor can be added based on project scope.)*
