# DevSecOps Project 1
This repository demonstrates a DevSecOps workflow that integrates infrastructure as code, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and security practices. The project utilizes Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration, and ArgoCD for continuous deployment.


## Project Overview
This project showcases a complete DevSecOps pipeline that automates the deployment of a sample application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The workflow includes:

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Using Terraform to define and provision the required cloud infrastructure.
* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implementing automated build, test, and deployment processes with GitHub Actions.
* Security Integration: Incorporating security checks and scans at various stages of the pipeline to ensure compliance and vulnerability management.
* Continuous Deployment: Utilizing ArgoCD for declarative GitOps-based deployment to AKS.
Architecture

## The architecture of this project includes the following components:

* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Hosts the containerized application workloads.
* Terraform: Manages the provisioning of Azure resources, including the AKS cluster.
* GitHub Actions: Automates the CI/CD pipeline, triggering workflows on code commits and pull requests.
* ArgoCD: Manages continuous deployment to the AKS cluster, ensuring the deployed applications match the desired state defined in Git.


## CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and includes the following workflows:

* Build and Test: On each push, the application is built, and tests are executed to ensure code quality.
* Security Scanning: Security tools scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.
* Deployment: Upon successful tests and scans, the application is deployed to the AKS cluster using ArgoCD. The workflow definitions are located in the .github/workflows directory.

## Security Integration
Security is integrated at multiple stages:

* Static Code Analysis: Tools like SonarQube analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities during the CI process.
* Dependency Scanning: The pipeline checks for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
* Container Image Scanning: Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
* Infrastructure Security: Terraform configurations are reviewed and scanned for security issues.

# Monitoring and Logging
* Monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the health and performance of the application. This project integrates monitoring and logging solutions to provide insights into the application's behavior and performance.
* Grafana and Prometheus
Grafana and Prometheus are used to monitor the application's performance and health. Prometheus collects and stores metrics, while Grafana provides a powerful and flexible dashboard for visualizing these metrics.
